# Introduction {-#chap-intro}

This handbook contains worked examples and write-ups for a variety of different statistical analyses and __R__ programming tips and tricks which are taught across the courses we deliver in the Department of Psychology at the University of Edinburgh.  

It has been written by the collective Stats Teaching Team, with content provided by tutors, senior teaching coordinators, and lecturers.<br>
<br>
The examples found here are a combination of both examples used in the taught courses and some written specifically for this handbook. Some are based on  simulated datasets, some on freely available datasets in the public domain, and some from researchers' own work.<br>
<br>
