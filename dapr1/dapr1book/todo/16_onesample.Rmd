# One Sample Mean

#### Instructions {-}
  
- In this two-hour lab we will go through worked examples in the first hour, and you will attempt to answer some questions in the second hour.
- The Rmarkdown file for this week is [here](https://uoe-psychology.github.io/uoe_psystats/dapr1/labsheets/week_16_practice.Rmd).

## Recap


- sampling, sampling distribution
- hypothesis testing
- relies on sampling distribution. we saw in several weeks how to generate sampling distributions
- last week, we saw how we could also do things theoretically, assuming a shape, and using a formula
- this all about standard error (i.e. how much our statistic varies between samples). 
  - with NFL, we took lots of samples to see how their mean salaries varied (week 11) - (sampling many times from population)
  - we then looked at how we could use bootstrapping to approximate this (week 12) - (*re*sampling many times from the original sample)
  - finally, we saw how we could do it theoretically - just one sample, assume a shape, use a formula
  - SE = SD of bootstrap distribution, = sigma/sqrt(n)

we can't do 1 (unless we actually take lots of samples from a population), but we can do 2 (with a computer) or 3 (by hand, or simple calculator).

- this is really important - we've got two ways of doing things now:
1- traditional, theoretical way, assuming SE = sigma/sqrt(n). assumes normal shaped sampling dist
2- computationally heavy, simulated way. bootstrap SE



## Walkthrough  

testing one sample mean.  

- bootstrapping

- traditional 

- comparison


- random variables (T when null is true looks like ...)
- our question "how surprising is bar(x)?" is now turned into "how surprising is T?". 
- df
