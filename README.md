# Univeristy of Edinburgh Psychology Statistics Course Content  

In each course directory, there are subdirectories for lectures, labs, and lab_solutions (where necessary).  

There is also a live directory, in which all the current materials being taught this year (2019/20) are held.  
  
/live is not a place to, e.g., link to from Learn. 
In the future, /live can be replaced with a submodule for a static webpage (e.g., Milan's psystats.github.io page). 
Currently, different courses have content written/compiled in different ways.  
The majority are written in .rmd, and compiled either as a bookdown or with the teachR package.
