# Univeristy of Edinburgh Psychology Statistics Course Content  

In each course directory, there are subdirectories for lectures, labs, lab_solutions (where necessary), and data.  

There is also a live directory, in which all the current materials being taught this year (2019/20) are held.  
  
Currently, different courses have content written/compiled in different ways.
