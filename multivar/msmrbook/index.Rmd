# Overview of the Course{-}  

**Multivariate Statistics and Methodology using R ** extends what you learnt last semester in **USMR** to provide an advanced level overview of statistical analysis techniques and methodology issues relevant to psychological research, introducing analysis tools that extend to cases where multiple outcome variables are being studied simultaneously, and hierarchical data structures (e.g., children nested in classes nested in schools).   

----

On this page you will find the weekly lab exercises, along with links to useful content online, walkthroughs, etc.    
The labs will begin to require a little more initiative than those from USMR, so be prepared to do some googling!  
Each week, solutions (where available) will be made available here for the previous weeks' lab.

## R stuff {-}  

We will be getting to grips with a lot of new tools for data manipulation and visualisation, using some of the packages pictured below. Some of you may be familiar with some of these already, but don't worry if not!  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# packages<-c("tidyverse","tidyr","dplyr","ggplot2","rmarkdown")
# downloadsticker<-function(x){
#   download.file(
#     url = glue::glue("https://github.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/raw/master/PNG/{x}.png"),
#     destfile = file.path("images/hex_files", glue::glue("{x}.png"))
#   ) 
# }
# invisible(purrr::map(packages,~downloadsticker(.)))
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchelloharawild/hexwall/master/hexwall.R")
hexwall("images/hex_files",sticker_row_size = 8, sticker_width=121)
```

### R Cheatsheets{-}
You can find a collection of cheatshets that summarise some of the most useful commands you will be using for tasks such as data transformation, visualisation, RMarkdown and many others [here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)/

Some key ones for this course are:  

- [RMarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
- [Data Visualisation (ggplot2)](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)
- [Data transformation with dplyr](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)
- [Data Import](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf)
