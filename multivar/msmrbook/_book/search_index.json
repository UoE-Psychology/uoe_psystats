On this page you will find the weekly lab exercises, along with links to useful content online, walkthroughs, etc. The labs will begin to require a little more initiative than those from USMR, so be prepared to do some googling! Each week, solutions (where available) will be made available here for the previous weeks’ lab. The team Lecturers: Dr Aja Murray: aja.murray@ed.ac.uk (Course Organiser) Dr Dan Mirman: daniel.mirman@ed.ac.uk Senior Teching Coordinators: pg.ppls.stats@ed.ac.uk Dr Umberto Noe Dr Josiah King R stuff We will be getting to grips with a lot of new tools for data manipulation and visualisation, using some of the packages pictured below.
