# Background

R for Data Science: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html

* Data visualization: Chapters 3 and 28
* Data management (tidyverse): Chapters 5 and 12

# Data Visualization with `ggplot`

Visualization is the first step in analysis

## Exercise 1
Kraus et al. (2019) *Evidence for the reproduction of social class in brief speech*, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (Study 1)

* N=189 speakers from the International Dialects of (North American) English Archive. Narrative speech and reading stories. 
* Extracted 7 individual words that were produced by all speakers: "And", "From", "Thought", "Beautiful", "Imagine", "Yellow", and "The". 
* Participants (N=229, from AMT)
    + Listened to the 7 one-word clips 
    + Estimated the speakerâ€™s race, gender, age, and educational attainment
    + Each participant completed this for a random subset of 27 speakers

```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
load("../data/Kraus_etal2019_Study1.Rdata")
summary(speech_ses)
```

## Exercise 1

A. Make a summary plot showing overall accuracy for each category of judgment

B. Explore different ways of showing variability: 

* Errorbar
* Pointrange
* Boxplot
* Violin plot
* Jitter

C. Combine a visualization of the overall accuracy and the variability

D. Refine the plot by, for example, removing unnecessary elements, adding useful annotations (e.g., chance performance = 50%), selecting a good color scheme, etc.

## Exercise 1 Solution
```{r}
# A. Make a summary plot showing overall accuracy for each category of judgment
ggplot(speech_ses, aes(x = Category, y = Accuracy, fill = Category)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="bar")
 
# B. Explore different ways of showing variability: 
# 
# * Errorbar
ggplot(speech_ses, aes(x = Category, y = Accuracy, colour = Category)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom="errorbar")
# * Pointrange
ggplot(speech_ses, aes(x = Category, y = Accuracy, colour = Category)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom="pointrange")
# * Boxplot
ggplot(speech_ses, aes(x = Category, y = Accuracy, fill = Category)) +
  geom_boxplot()
# * Violin plot
ggplot(speech_ses, aes(x = Category, y = Accuracy, fill = Category)) +
  geom_violin()
# * Jitter
ggplot(speech_ses, aes(x = Category, y = Accuracy, colour = Category)) +
  geom_jitter(width=0.2, alpha=0.5)

# C. Combine a visualization of the overall accuracy and the variability

ggplot(speech_ses, aes(x = Category, y = Accuracy, colour = Category)) +
  geom_jitter(width=0.2, alpha=0.5) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom="errorbar", 
               colour="black", width=0.4, size=1.5)

# D. Refine the plot by, for example, removing unnecessary elements, adding useful annotations (e.g., chance performance = 50%), selecting a good color scheme, etc.
ggplot(speech_ses, aes(x = Category, y = Accuracy, colour = Category)) +
  geom_jitter(width=0.2, alpha=0.5) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom="errorbar", 
               colour="black", width=0.4, size=1.5) +
  guides(colour = FALSE) + theme_bw() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  geom_hline(yintercept=50, linetype="dashed")
```

## Exercise 2

A. Pick a published graph and make a better version of it

B. Graphs are usually better than tables. Find a table of results and convert it to a graph.

# Data management with `tidyverse`

## Exercise 1
Using the `exam.sav` data:

A. Calculate the class average score for each exam

B. Calculate the overall average exam score separately for the male students and the female students

C. Calculate the average score for each exam separately for male and female students

## Exercise 1 Solution
```{r ex1, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
exam <- haven::read_sav("../data/exam.sav")

# A. Calculate the class average score for each exam
exam %>% group_by(exam) %>% 
  summarize(M = mean(scores))

# B. Calculate the overall average exam score separately for 
#     the male students and the female students
exam %>% group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarize(M = mean(scores))

# C. Calculate the average score for each exam separately for 
#    male and female students
exam %>% group_by(exam, gender) %>% 
  summarize(M = mean(scores))

#    use spread() to make it easier to compare
exam %>% group_by(exam, gender) %>% 
  summarize(M = mean(scores)) %>% 
  spread(gender, M)
```

## Exercise 2
The `USArrests` data set contains violent crime arrests (per 100,000 residents) in each of the 50 states in the USA in 1973 and the percent of the population of each state that lived in urban areas.

A. Convert the USArrests data set from a wide to a long format so that instead of separate variables for each crime type (Murder, Assault, Rape), there is one variable that identifies the crime type and one variable that contains the rates for each crime type for each state.

B. Make a scatterplot showing the relationship between each type of violent crime rate and percent of population living in urban areas. 

## Exercise 2 Solution
A. Convert the USArrests data set from a wide to a long format so that instead of separate variables for each crime type (Murder, Assault, Rape), there is one variable that identifies the crime type and one variable that contains the rates for each crime type for each state.
```{r}
x <- gather(USArrests, key="CrimeType", value="Rate", 
            Murder, Assault, Rape)
```

B. Make a scatterplot showing the relationship between each type of violent crime rate and percent of population living in urban areas.
```{r fig.height=3}
ggplot(x, aes(UrbanPop, Rate)) + 
  facet_wrap(~CrimeType, scales="free", nrow=1) + 
  geom_point() + stat_smooth(method="lm")
```

## Exercise 3
The `psych::ability` data set contains accuracy of 1525 subjects on 16 multiple choice IQ-test-type questions. The questions are of 4 types: basic reasoning, letter sequence, matrix reasoning, and spatial rotation. There are four questions of each type. Tidy the data and make a graph of average accuracy for each question type.

## Exercise 3 Solution

```{r fig.height=4, warning=FALSE}
iq <- as_tibble(psych::ability) %>% 
  gather(key="Item", value="Correct", 1:16) %>%
  separate(Item, c("Domain", "Number"))
ggplot(iq, aes(Domain, Correct)) + 
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom="bar")
```

# R Markdown

## Exercise 1: Compile a script into a report

Open your script from the exercises so far. Compile a HTML report from that script.

<!-- ![Compile report](../figs/CompileReport.png) -->

## Exercise 2: Convert a script into a R Notebook
A. Create a new `R Notebook` file, fill it in using the content of your script. Knit the notebook into a HTML or PDF file.

Hints:

* Comments become plain text
* R code goes into R chunks

B. Add formatting to make it look nicer: headers, bold, italics, etc.

C. Add chunk options to suppress extraneous messages and warnings, and to control the size of figures.
