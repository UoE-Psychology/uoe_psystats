# Introduction {-#chap-intro}

test questions.
the code is in dropdowns.R file, which is sourced at the start of the bookdown.
the .css and toggling script is included in toggle.html, which is then incuded in_header in the yaml


`r qbegin()`
question the first
`r qend()`

`r solbegin()`
hello, i'm a solution.
`r solend()`

`r qbegin()`
question again
`r qend()`

`r solbegin()`
peppa pig. 

i think these will just number through the whole book, so it won't reset each chapter, which is not ideal. 
`r solend()`




## Course description {-}

Data analysis for psychology in R 2 or, in short, DAPR2, is a new course offered by the School of Psychology of the University of Edinburgh from the academic year 2020-2021.

The target audience for this course are second year students in the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences (PPLS) of the University of Edinburgh.

The course aims to provide students with the tools to analyse the data collected in order to answer specific research questions of interest.



## Prerequisites {-}

Students should have had an introductory course on statistics at about the level of @Lock2016, _Statistics: Unlocking the power of data_, or @Moore1993, _Introduction to the Practice of Statistics_, and be familiar with _t_-tests, _p_-values, confidence intervals, and the basics of correlation.
